The **junior science program** is a new introduction to Australia, but it's quickly becoming a prominent extension program for young students across the country. For any young people wanting to get into the senior programs, this is a good starting block. 

It covers 3 disciplines - specifically **physics**, **chemistry**, and **biology** - each to a Year 11/12 level. As such, you would be expected to pick **basic** units from physics and chemistry, and any from **biology** since those will be specific to JSO.

For samples, you may wish to look at the following:
- [(Physics) Linear Motion](linear_motion.md)
- [(Chemistry) Bonding](bonding.md)
- [(Biology) Cells](bio_cells.md)
